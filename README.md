# MicroBehavior Workplace Personality Assessment

A behavioral-based personality assessment that analyzes micro-behaviors to determine workplace personality types and culture fit. Unlike traditional Myers-Briggs or Big Five assessments, this tool focuses on small, observable behaviors to provide actionable insights into work styles and team dynamics.

## üß† Overview

The assessment evaluates 10 core workplace personality traits through 30 micro-behaviors - small, specific actions that reveal deeper personality patterns. Users answer 15 randomized questions on a 5-point Likert scale, receiving personalized insights into their work style, strengths, and growth edges.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices with smooth animations
- **Dual Personality Types**: Shows primary and secondary types when scores are close
- **Balanced Insights**: Includes both strengths and growth edges for each personality type
- **Work Culture Matching**: Maps personality traits to specific workplace environments

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Micro-Behavioral Focus**: Instead of asking "Are you an extrovert?", we ask "I'm the first one on the dance floor at events" - capturing actual behaviors that reveal personality patterns.

**Balanced Insights**: Every personality type includes both workplace strengths and growth edges, avoiding the "horoscope effect" of purely positive feedback.

**Mobile-First Experience**: Touch-optimized interface with smooth transitions and progress tracking for modern user expectations.

The assessment is designed for:
- **Individual Development** - Understanding personal work style and preferences
- **Team Building** - Identifying complementary personalities and potential friction points
- **Hiring Support** - Evaluating culture fit during recruitment processes
- **Management Training** - Developing awareness of different work styles and communication needs

## üìà Future Enhancements

## ü§ù Contributing
